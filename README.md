Adds a new placeable tile, the Deer Effigy. It ward off Deerclops from naturally spawning in the Snow Biome during a Blizzard at midnight, in a 200 tile range around it.  

The Effigy is dropped by Deerclops, 100% chance on first kill after the mod is enabled, and then 25% each time after. This mod doesn't try to evade fighting Deerclops at all, rather stop him from spawning so frequently, making Snow Biome bases too annoying to do.
